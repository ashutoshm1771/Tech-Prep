- Storing previous values for further usage.
- We use it for 3 reason.
 -> Combinatorics : Count something , often number of ways

  	   : YES / NO questions

Comparison 

Iteration          	Recursion
- Speed                 - Easier to apply
- Easier Complexity     - Fewer states
- Shorter code          - Order doesn't matter
- Harder techniques
